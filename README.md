Memory Game, Built with React!
==============================
Play game here: 

  This is the production version of EnzoCodes front end
React App. To play, attempt to click all 20 tiles without
clicking the same tile twice. Each time you click, the tiles
will be shuffled. Duplicate clicks will reset the game. The
top score attainable is 20. Good luck!


  Running this app locally may be tricky, as this is the 'build' version.
